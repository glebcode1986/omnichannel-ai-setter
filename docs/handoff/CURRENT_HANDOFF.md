## Product UX direction

Primary daily surface is the **Unified Inbox**, not Analytics. Navigation: Inbox, Review, Leads, Knowledge, Style, Analytics, Settings.

Desktop Inbox is three-pane: conversation list / active thread / contact+lead+AI context. Mobile is stacked with details as drawer/sheet.

`Review` is first-class for DRAFT, low-confidence, missing fact, unsupported/sensitive cases, Instagram human-assisted sends, WhatsApp template review, transcription/media failures and ambiguous-send resolution.

Knowledge and Style are intentionally separate:
- Knowledge = factual authority, versioned/provenanced;
- Style = phrasing/tone, verified human examples only, never factual authority.

Phase 5 can begin incrementally after the relevant backend contracts stabilize; it does not need to wait for all WhatsApp work. One product shell conditionally renders channel capabilities.

## WhatsApp after-window product decision — Accepted

1. `SERVICE_WINDOW_ONLY`
2. `TEMPLATE_REVIEW`
3. `TEMPLATE_AUTOPILOT` with explicit allowlist

No stored choice means `SERVICE_WINDOW_ONLY`. Empty autopilot allowlist means no unattended template send. Current consent/template/account-health/STOP rules always override automation.

## Execution state right now

**Stage D has started with P5-01 (Issue #27)**, on branch `feat/p5-01-app-shell-onboarding`, based on the
accepted #72 head. Everything before it in the chain has an independent PASS at its published head,
including **#72 / P3-03 at `9955ecf6c114145d54bb7dd46abbc902267bd00c`**. Everything before it in the chain
has an independent PASS at its published head, including **#71 / P2-09 at
`38df858508ec61e2c6821e47a0a5225c86768223`**, **#70 / P2-08 at
`c15a9a6f558d9270263ad7573669f76ca3af8ac0`**, **#69 / P2-07 at
`4c9f496d805316ded56311e41bdd4c3c39ff5a43`** and **#68 / P2-06 at
`fb35665209b90c82bc10f3068450111e75f83299`**; all are propagated downstream. #72 is the last branch in the
chain, nothing is merged to `main`, and Stage D has not started.

Phase 1 and Phase 2 are one stacked chain of unmerged PRs, each branch based on its parent:

`#26 -> #49 -> #50 -> #51 -> #52 -> #63 -> #64 -> #65 -> #66 -> #67 -> #68 -> #69 -> #70 -> #71 -> #72`

The Phase 1 tasks named in the launch plan are all implemented and sit in that chain; the per-PR detail is
under "Phase 1 implementation stack" below. What the architecture review of PR #26 settled is still binding
and is recorded there.

## Phase 1 implementation stack (temporary review-lag mode, Issue #7)

Implemented as stacked PRs awaiting independent review, in dependency order:

1. #26 (#2): workspace scaffold.
2. #49 (#3): domain + channel contracts.
3. #50 (#4): Prisma/Auth.js/workspace isolation.
4. #51 (#5): BullMQ delay primitives.
5. #52 (#6): channel-neutral webhook ingestion with a transactional outbox, scoped to the Business Profile resolved from the channel account (see `docs/specs/ARCHITECTURE.md` implementation notes).

6. #62 (#37): the GitHub Actions `pnpm verify` gate, staged at `docs/ci/verify.yml` because the implementation credential cannot write `.github/workflows/`.

Nothing is merged yet.

**Phase 2 start condition (MASTER Issue #61).** The owner's Stage B directive starts Phase 2 once the Issue #53 Business Profile sync is complete, which it now is (#49 `34a71d0`, #50 `1e214bf`, #51 `53a254f`, #52 `405bfd0`). Phase 2 work is therefore stacked on top of #52 and stays unmerged, under the same review-lag mode: Phase 1 acceptance is still required before anything merges.

7. P2-01 (#8): `packages/channel-instagram` — the Instagram transport adapter and its fixture suite. It is not registered in `apps/web` yet: per-account credentials arrive with P2-02, so webhook routes still answer 404.
9. P2-03 (#10): the provider-neutral AI draft engine — `ReplyModel` port and Zod boundary in `packages/application`, an Anthropic implementation in `packages/ai`, idempotent draft persistence, and the worker's `generateAiDraft` handler wired. Retrieval (#11) and the policy engine (#12) are not: drafts are produced and stored, never sent.
10. P2-04 (#11): factual and style retrieval — application-owned `KnowledgeRetriever`/`StyleRetriever`/`EmbeddingProvider` ports with deterministic RRF fusion, PostgreSQL lexical + pgvector semantic retrieval in `packages/db`, a Voyage embedding provider in `packages/ai`, and retrieval wired into the worker's draft handler. Nothing writes knowledge or style yet: ingestion and the knowledge/style UX are Phase 5, so in a fresh deployment both corpora are empty and every fact-dependent answer becomes `MISSING_FACT`.

8. P2-02 (#9): Instagram Login onboarding and token lifecycle — connect/callback/disconnect routes, encrypted credential storage, single-use OAuth state and refresh handling. The adapter is registered in `apps/web` by the vertical slice (#16), which resolves each account's own credential.

11. P2-05 (#12), PR #67: the deterministic policy engine. Human Agent eligibility is current-only — an `ELIGIBLE` fact whose `expiresAt` has passed (including exactly at `now`) never opens the after-window path.
12. P2-06 (#13), PR #68: the delivery coordinator and final pre-send revalidation.
13. P2-07 (#14), PR #69: human handoff and the review state machine.
14. P2-08 (#15), PR #70: the AI evaluation harness and golden conversations.
15. P2-09 (#16), PR #71: the Instagram vertical slice.
16. P3-03 (#56), PR #72: reliability controls, health, kill switch and reconciliation. ADR-017 is **Rejected**: an unmatched echo stays native human activity, and an unresolved ambiguous send is quarantined and put in front of a person rather than retried blind.

**A reviewed reply carries the authority the person granted (#14 / PR #69).** Approving or editing a draft
persists *who* approved it, *when*, and *which send* they authorized on the delivery row, and the
coordinator reads it from there with everything else it judges. The worker can no longer construct an
authority, which is how a human's approval was silently downgraded to automation — the reply then met the
gates that exist to ask for a human, and the Human Agent transport path was unreachable. Scheduling the
send and taking the conversation are now one write, so there is no moment in which an approved delivery
exists with nobody owning the conversation. The policy engine judges "may this be sent on this authority":
an approval answers the gates that ask for a human and none of those about what is possible or permitted,
and a takeover by anyone else still fails closed. See `docs/specs/HUMAN_HANDOFF.md`.

**Two languages, never coupled (#58 / P5-10).** The dashboard locale is a per-user preference on
`users.ui_locale`; the language a customer is answered in comes from the Business Profile's style profile
and the conversation. An agency operator may read Russian while replying in German for a business
configured in English, and all three are correct at once. The separation is structural — different rows,
different owners, no query that reads one to decide the other — and an integration test states it rather
than trusting it. Missing keys throw in development and fall back to English in production, because a
person mid-task must not be shown a raw key. See `docs/specs/LOCALIZATION.md`.

**Onboarding readiness is evaluated, never stored (#27 / P5-01).** `BusinessProfile` already said why:
status is not operational readiness, and readiness is evaluated at execution time. So the setup checklist
is a pure function of the profile's own configuration, read now — which is also what makes onboarding
resumable without a state machine, because the completed steps *are* the channel account, the policy row
and the knowledge documents. The single stored fact is a deliberate skip, because "no style yet" and "we
decided not to write one" look identical in a style table and only one of them should let a workspace go
live. Activation re-judges the checklist inside the transaction that flips the status, so a page left open
for an hour cannot assert what was true when it rendered. See `docs/specs/ONBOARDING_UX.md`.

**A kill switch is only as strong as the boundary it is enforced at (#56 / PR #72).** Binding the switch
to the delivery claim was not enough on its own: the ordering lived in a store method, so it bound callers
who went through that method and nobody else — while this spec's own incident guidance says the table is
written to by hand. A `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger now takes the scope's advisory key, so
every activation route participates, including direct SQL. The cost is the key being spelled in both SQL
and TypeScript, and a mismatch has no symptom — the claim would simply stop waiting — so a test holds the
two derivations against each other and pins the property that matters: a switch that covers a send derives
a key that send's claim already holds. See `docs/specs/RELIABILITY_INCIDENTS.md`.

**A kill switch is not a request for someone to look (#56 / PR #72).** Merging the accepted #71 head down
raised the question directly: the policy engine now skips the gates that mean "a person should look at
this" once a person has, and an operator's suspension sits among them in the same function. It stays
unconditional. What an approval answers is a request for human attention; a kill switch is an operator
saying nothing may leave, and a click recorded before they said it does not answer that. Making it
authority-aware would build the one path around the switch. `AUTOMATION_SUSPENDED` is asserted in
`packages/application/src/policy/evaluate.test.ts`, which is new: the reason code existed and no test in
the repository named it.

**A skipped suite and a passing suite look the same (#16 / PR #71).** `pnpm verify` runs the whole test
run without a database or Redis, so DB-backed suites skip there by design and the infrastructure scripts
are what execute them. A new integration suite in a project no infrastructure script named therefore
reported "skipped" inside a green CI run, and the defect it reproduced was never exercised in the review
gate. `pnpm test:e2e` now runs `@omnichannel/web` as well as `@omnichannel/worker`, and
`scripts/verification/gate.test.ts` fails whenever a project owns an integration suite that no
infrastructure script runs.

**A channel is only real where it is composed (#16 / PR #71).** Every part of the inbound half passed its
own tests while `apps/web` registered no adapter at all, so no webhook reached signature verification,
normalization, persistence, the outbox or debounce; and the final policy gate answered the Human Agent
question with a hard-coded `UNKNOWN`, so the outbound half could never choose the tagged transport no
matter what a person had authorized. Both are now wired through the normal composition roots — the web
app binds an adapter per resolved channel account and reads that account's own credential through its
relation, and the worker hands one live `INSTAGRAM_HUMAN_AGENT_APPROVAL` to the draft disposition, the
final channel-state resolver and the sender alike. Missing configuration binds no adapter, which refuses
the webhook before anything is stored. See `docs/specs/INSTAGRAM_ADAPTER.md` and ADR-014.

**Delivery send authority is bound to the claim (#13 / PR #68).** The final pre-send revalidation is no
longer separated from the claim by an unguarded gap: the claim's own statement re-asserts every fact the
revalidation rested on — reply cycle, conversation state and version, draft, account health and the
automation-policy rows the mode and limits came from. A claim whose facts have moved is refused as
state-changed, re-read and re-judged, and the change is normally what then cancels or holds the delivery.
Nothing is sent and no attempt is counted. See `docs/specs/DELIVERY_COORDINATOR.md`.

**The unified Inbox reads by cursor and admits what it does not know (#28 / PR pending).** One operational
inbox over Instagram and WhatsApp, three panes on a desktop and one screen at a time on a phone. The view
— search, filters, the open conversation, the page position — lives entirely in the URL, so a reload, the
back button and a pasted link agree about it and the list works before JavaScript arrives. There are no
read receipts: what an inbox calls unread is "the customer spoke last and nobody answered", so the filter
says "Awaiting reply" and means it. Paging is `(lastMessageAt, id)` cursors over a bounded page rather
than offsets, because an inbox reorders itself constantly and page two of an offset query repeats and
skips rows. Two bugs came out of that work: the page returned a cursor whenever it *filled*, so data
ending on a page boundary offered a "load older" link that loaded nothing — and in a refilled page the
same mistake dropped every conversation behind the fill point outright. Mode badges show the mode in
force, not the conversation's empty override, and the precedence now has one implementation
(`packages/db/src/automation-mode.ts`) shared with the draft pipeline. The Inbox reads and does not act:
approving and editing arrive with P5-03, and the panel says so rather than showing disabled buttons. See
the implementation notes in `docs/specs/PRODUCT_UX.md`.

**Gate C is PASS.** Stage C's only task, #56 / P3-03, was accepted as PR #72 at `9955ecf`, and the whole
#26→#72 chain has an independent PASS. Reliability controls, health reporting, kill switches and
reconciliation are in place: the dashboard may be closed while the server continues safely, dependency
failures degrade narrowly, and outbound can be stopped without losing inbound.

**A human-composed reply has an honest origin (ADR-018 Option B, accepted 2026-09-30).** The composer was
the one part of P5-03 that could not be built without a decision, because a delivery required an
`ai_drafts` row and a person's words are not a generation. Option B was accepted: `delivery_jobs.draft_id`
is nullable and the row carries `human_text` with its author, under CHECKs admitting **exactly one**
origin — never none, never both, never anonymous human wording, never an author on a model's draft, never
empty text, and never automation's authority on words a person typed. `ai_drafts` is untouched and stays
model-only, so no human reply reaches `readReliabilitySnapshot`, `countUnusableGenerations` or the evals.

The delivery coordinator is still the only path to a customer. A human-composed delivery is claimed by the
same atomic claim, re-asserts the same conversation facts in the same conditional update, and is refused
by the same policy, window, account-health, kill-switch and takeover gates. Its wording is part of the
guard, so an edit between the judgement and the claim refuses rather than sending something nobody judged.
Idempotency is the same decision digest the review path uses.

## Immediate next actions

**Reviewer note.** AntiGravity is temporarily unavailable due to reviewer limits, so Astra is the active
independent reviewer for this cycle.

1. **Four P5-05 blockers about reachability and atomicity (#31 / PR #77).** Astra's fourth pass on this
   branch. The previous repair was correct on every path its own tests walked; all four findings were
   about paths they did not.

   **An edited live source had no way to publish its staged version.** The store deliberately leaves an
   edited ACTIVE document at `publishedVersion = 1`, the page rendered the "saved v2, customers are
   answered with v1" warning — and its control branch offered Archive to every ACTIVE document and
   Publish only to DRAFTs. The store could do it and the operator could not reach it. The rule now lives
   in `knowledgeLifecycleOf`: a version that is not the published one is publishable whatever the
   status.

   **A missing version was accepted by the action that claimed to refuse it.** `editKnowledgeAction`
   parsed `expectedVersion` and, when it could not read one, omitted the property — and the store checks
   staleness only when it is present. A form that left the field out therefore edited whatever was
   current and reported `VERSIONED`: the whole stale-tab mechanism, steppable around by sending one fewer
   field. The decision moved to `knowledge-submission.ts`, where it is refused before the store is
   reached and can be run against requests no browser built.

   **Publish was not bound to the version the operator saw.** The form submitted no version, the action
   took no `FormData`, and the store published whatever was current when it started. Two tabs on the same
   draft was enough: one saves, the other clicks Publish, and content nobody reviewed is live under a
   success notice. The version now travels page → control → action → store, and a mismatch is a
   `CONFLICT`.

   **Publishing and recording an indexing failure could race into a raw constraint error.** Both read the
   row, decided, then wrote conditional on the version alone — so each could write the other's premise
   away and produce ACTIVE + FAILED + published-at-this-version, the triple the CHECK refuses. Each write
   now names every column its decision came from: the publish refuses with the sentence the pre-read
   would have given, and the health write re-decides once against the state that replaced it, archiving
   the source whose published version the publish just moved.

   **The lesson:** a correct store plus a correct screen is not a correct product. Three of the four were
   gaps *between* two correct pieces — a control that was never rendered, a field that was never required,
   a predicate that named one of the two facts it read.
1. **Three P5-05 concurrency blockers, two of them introduced by the previous repair.** Astra re-reviewed
   the repaired head and found that separating Save from Publish had not closed the interleavings it
   created. All three were correct.

   **A publish could report success having published nothing.** `restoreKnowledge` writes conditionally on
   the version it read — and discarded the row count, so a save landing in the gap meant zero rows changed
   while the action still mapped the result to `PUBLISHED`. The condition was there and its answer was
   thrown away, which is the mistake `recordIndexingResult` had been fixed for the day before.

   **A save was not bound to the version the form showed.** Two tabs at v1: A saves and becomes v2, B —
   still showing v1 — saves over it with wording composed against content it never saw. `expectedVersion`
   now travels page → form → action → store, the document moves first and conditionally, and the chunks
   are written only if it did. Two simultaneous submits cannot both become v2; the loser gets a conflict
   rather than a unique-constraint error from the chunks' position key.

   **A failure in an unpublished version archived the published one.** After publish/index v1 and Save v2,
   a failure to index v2 — content no customer has ever seen — took the document out of ACTIVE and stopped
   healthy v1 answering. `knowledge_documents_failed_not_active_check` was written when a document had one
   version; it is now about the version customers are answered with, and so is the store.

   **Found while fixing it:** the whole knowledge outcome family — CREATED, VERSIONED, UNCHANGED,
   PUBLISHED, ARCHIVED, RESTORED — was missing from `OutcomeNotice`'s allowlist and from both catalogues,
   so every save and publish redirected with an outcome the page ignored. The operator pressed Save and was
   told nothing, which is indistinguishable from pressing Save and nothing happening. A typed conflict
   nobody can see would have been the same defect in a new place.

   **The lesson:** a conditional write is only half a fix. The other half is reading what it did — and
   saying so on screen.
2. **Three P5-05 blockers, all correct (#31 / PR #77).**

   **Save published immediately.** Retrieval joined the document's latest *saved* version, so pressing
   Save on a live source put the new wording in front of customers at once — while
   `knowledge-editor.tsx` promised the opposite: "Never a live change... publishing is a separate,
   deliberate act". An operator half-way through rewording a refund policy was already answering with the
   half. `knowledge_documents.published_version` is now its own column, retrieval joins it, and only an
   explicit publish moves it. Editing a live source keeps answering with the wording somebody approved,
   and the detail page says which version is which, because an invariant the screen does not show is one
   the operator cannot act on.

   **An indexing result could certify content the worker never read.** `recordIndexingResult` took a
   document and a result and applied it to whatever version happened to be current. A delayed success for
   v1 arriving after an edit to v2 marked v2 INDEXED; a delayed failure archived a live source over a
   problem that no longer existed. The result now carries the version it is about and applies
   conditionally, in the database; anything else is `STALE` and writes nothing.

   **The library stopped at 25 rows.** The store paged and returned a cursor; the route never read one and
   the list never rendered a link, so the 26th source was unreachable unless the operator guessed a word
   from its title. `knowledge-view.ts` carries the cursor through the URL, and the next link is built from
   the incoming query rather than from re-serialized filters — a filter rebuilt from parsed values drifts
   the moment a parameter is added and forgotten, and the symptom is a "load more" that silently drops the
   search.

   **The lesson across all three:** each was a correct piece of code reading a value that had stopped
   meaning what it used to. `version` stopped meaning "what customers get" the moment publishing became
   separate; a document id stopped identifying content the moment versions existed; a cursor the store
   returns means nothing until a route spends it.
2. **A human-composed reply was invisible in its own conversation (#29 / PR #76).** Astra's blocking
   finding, and it was correct. ADR-018 Option B made `delivery_jobs.draft_id` nullable and gave a
   human-composed delivery a direct `conversation_id`, but two read paths still reached the conversation
   through `draft: { conversationId }`: the Inbox's pending sends and the cancellation lookup. So a reply
   a person had just written did not appear in the thread, `cancelSend` answered `GONE`, and the row sat
   `SCHEDULED` and went out — the operator was told their reply was not queued, and then it was.

   Both now spread `deliveryOfConversation(conversationId)` from `packages/db/src/delivery-origin.ts`,
   one place that knows what "belongs to this conversation" means for either origin. A third instance of
   the same mistake was found while fixing it: the reconciliation sweep's orphaned-row query selected the
   conversation only through the draft, so an ambiguous human-composed send was raised with an empty
   conversation id — which the queue's payload schema rejects, so it was never raised at all.

   **The lesson, for the next nullable relation:** making a column optional is not the change. The change
   is every query that assumed it was there, and the compiler cannot find them because a relation filter
   that matches nothing is still valid. Grep for the relation, not for the column.
2. **Stage D is open across six stacked branches**, each CI-green with evidence posted:
   #73 (P5-01 shell/onboarding), #74 (P5-10 EN/RU), #75 (P5-02 Inbox), #76 (P5-03 review + composer,
   now complete), #77 (P5-05 Knowledge), #78 (P5-06 Style), #79 (P5-04 AI settings + simulation).
   `feat/p5-07-leads-pipeline` carries the P5-07 store and is not yet a PR.
2. **Fixes go to the earliest affected branch and merge down the chain.** No rebases, no force-pushes,
   no merges to `main`.
3. **P5-07 / Issue #33 (Leads) is the open work.** Its store, migration and tests are committed; the
   kanban and table views are not built yet. One product question is open: the spec allows a Workspace to
   *add* stages, which would require `LeadStage` to stop being an enum — and the draft engine returns one
   in its structured output, so that is a decision, not a display preference.
4. Every surface must take its text from `apps/web/src/i18n/catalogue.ts`; `no-unlocalized-strings.test.ts`
   fails the build otherwise. New Inbox panes are also held by
   `apps/web/src/ui/inbox/no-provider-payloads.test.ts`, which fails if a pane imports a channel package
   or names a provider payload type.
5. No rebases, no force-pushes, and no merges to `main`.
4. Continue architecture/product design in parallel without letting future prepared phases bypass dependency
   gates.

Historical note: the original launch sequence (review #2, then launch #3 from a merged `main`) was
superseded by the owner's stacked review-lag mode. Those tasks are implemented and are in the chain above.
