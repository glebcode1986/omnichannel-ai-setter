# Current Handoff

**Date:** 2026-09-16  
**Phase:** Phase 1 implementation in progress; Phase 2 Instagram/shared-AI fully specified; Phase 4 WhatsApp fully architected; Phase 5 SaaS UX fully specified/task-contracted  
**Repository:** `glebcode1986/omnichannel-ai-setter`

## Completed architecture/documentation

- Durable project memory, agent rules and task-contract workflow.
- OpenSetter + wacrm upstream extraction/reuse strategy with MIT notices.
- Frozen stack: Next.js/TypeScript, pnpm, Prisma/PostgreSQL, BullMQ/Redis, Auth.js, Zod, Vitest.
- Channel-neutral core, webhook ingestion boundary, durable debounce/delay, deterministic policy, final pre-send revalidation, atomic delivery claim, ambiguity quarantine and human takeover design.
- Complete Phase 1 issues/contracts #2–#7.
- Complete Phase 2 Instagram/shared-AI specs/ADRs/issues/contracts #8–#17.
- Instagram owner choice accepted: `STANDARD_ONLY | HUMAN_ASSISTED_EXTENDED` (ADR-014).
- Complete Phase 4 WhatsApp architecture/backlog/contracts #18–#25; ADR-015 Embedded Signup and ADR-016 three-mode outside-window policy accepted.
- Stable human-supervisor launch page: `docs/tasks/CLAUDE_EXECUTION_QUEUE.md`.
- Complete Phase 5 SaaS UX specs/issues/contracts #27–#36.

## Product UX direction

Primary daily surface is the **Unified Inbox**, not Analytics. Navigation: Inbox, Review, Leads, Knowledge, Style, Analytics, Settings.

Desktop Inbox is three-pane: conversation list / active thread / contact+lead+AI context. Mobile is stacked with details as drawer/sheet.

`Review` is first-class for DRAFT, low-confidence, missing fact, unsupported/sensitive cases, Instagram human-assisted sends, WhatsApp template review, transcription/media failures and ambiguous-send resolution.

Knowledge and Style are intentionally separate:
- Knowledge = factual authority, versioned/provenanced;
- Style = phrasing/tone, verified human examples only, never factual authority.

Phase 5 can begin incrementally after the relevant backend contracts stabilize; it does not need to wait for all WhatsApp work. One product shell conditionally renders channel capabilities.

## WhatsApp after-window product decision — Accepted

1. `SERVICE_WINDOW_ONLY`
2. `TEMPLATE_REVIEW`
3. `TEMPLATE_AUTOPILOT` with explicit allowlist

No stored choice means `SERVICE_WINDOW_ONLY`. Empty autopilot allowlist means no unattended template send. Current consent/template/account-health/STOP rules always override automation.

## Execution state right now

Claude is reported by the product owner to be working on **P1-01 / Issue #2**.

The next Claude task is prepared:
- **P1-02 / Issue #3 — domain model and channel contracts**
- contract: `docs/tasks/P1-02_CLAUDE_TASK_CONTRACT.md`
- branch: `feat/p1-02-domain-channel-contracts`
- hard start condition: Issue #2 reviewed/accepted/merged into `main`.

Do not start actual Phase 2 implementation until Phase 1 exit criteria are met unless architecture is explicitly amended.

## Execution order

### Phase 1 — current coding path
#2 -> #3 -> #4/#5 -> #6 with #7 independent review.
Use `docs/tasks/CLAUDE_EXECUTION_QUEUE.md`.

### Phase 2 — Instagram/shared AI
#8–#16 Claude; #17 independent review. Contracts under `docs/tasks/P2-*`.

### Phase 4 — WhatsApp
#18–#24 Claude; #25 independent review. Contracts under `docs/tasks/P4-*`.

### Phase 5 — SaaS UX
- #27 P5-01 app shell + resumable onboarding — `P5-01_CLAUDE_TASK_CONTRACT.md`
- #28 P5-02 unified Inbox — `P5-02_CLAUDE_TASK_CONTRACT.md`
- #29 P5-03 conversation operations + Review Queue — `P5-03_CLAUDE_TASK_CONTRACT.md`
- #30 P5-04 AI Settings + no-send simulation — `P5-04_CLAUDE_TASK_CONTRACT.md`
- #31 P5-05 Knowledge Library — `P5-05_CLAUDE_TASK_CONTRACT.md`
- #32 P5-06 Style Training — `P5-06_CLAUDE_TASK_CONTRACT.md`
- #33 P5-07 Leads pipeline — `P5-07_CLAUDE_TASK_CONTRACT.md`
- #34 P5-08 Analytics + Audit — `P5-08_CLAUDE_TASK_CONTRACT.md`

- #36 R5 independent review — `R5_CODEX_ASTRA_REVIEW_CONTRACT.md`

See `docs/specs/PRODUCT_UX.md`, `ONBOARDING_UX.md`, `AI_CONFIGURATION_UX.md`, `KNOWLEDGE_STYLE_UX.md`, `LEADS_ANALYTICS_UX.md`, and `PHASE5_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## Coding rule for every new session

Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, this file, `docs/tasks/CLAUDE_EXECUTION_QUEUE.md`, `docs/tasks/README.md`, relevant ADR/spec/research file and exact issue/task contract. Do not reconstruct architecture from chat history.

## Immediate next actions

1. Let Claude finish P1-01/#2 and open a PR; do not auto-merge.
2. Review #2 against its contract and run R1/Codex-Astra review.
3. After #2 merge, launch P1-02/#3 from fresh `main`.
4. Continue architecture/product design in parallel without letting future prepared phases bypass dependency gates.
